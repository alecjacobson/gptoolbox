% CONNECTEDCOMPONENT Compute the connected components of a subset of triangles
% on a tri surface. Two faces are considered connected if they share an edge.

% Inputs:
%   TT  face-face topology, Fx3 (you can use the function tt(F) to compute it)
%   TAG  subset of faces where the connected components are computed, Fx1
% Outputs:
%   C  cell array of connected components. Every element of the cell array
%      contains the indices of the faces in the corresponding connected
%      component
%
% Use size(C) to know the number of connected components detected
