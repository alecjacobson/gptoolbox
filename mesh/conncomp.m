function [S,C] = conncomp(G)
  % CONNCOMP Drop in replacement for graphconncomp.m from the bioinformatics
  % toobox. G is an n by n adjacency matrix, then this identifies the S
  % connected components C. This is also an order of magnitude faster.

  % Inputs:
  %   G  n by n adjacency matrix
  % Outputs:
  %   S  scalar number of connected components
  %   C
