function [w,a,R] = axisanglebetween(u,v,nan_replacement)
  % AXISANGLEBETWEEN compute the axis and angle representation of the rotation
  % between two vectors
  %
  % [w,a] = axisanglebetween(u,v)
  % [w,a] = axisanglebetween(u,v,nan_replacement) same as above but NaN rows
  % resulting from angle exactly pi are replaced with nan_replacement
  %
  % Inputs:
  %   u  n by dim list of row vectors
  %   v  n by dim list of row vectors
  %   Optional:
  %     nan_replacement vector replacement for NaN rows in w
  % Outputs:
  %   w  n by 3 list of axis vectors, if dim = 2 then this is as if u v had 0s
  %     as z coordinates, NaNs may appear if angle is exactly pi
  %   a  n by 1 list of angles
