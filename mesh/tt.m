function [Fp, Fi] = tt(F)
  % TT Build a face adjacency data structure for a **manifold** triangle mesh.
  % From each face we can find where on its neighboring faces it's incident.
  %
  % [Fp, Fi] = tt(F)
  %
  % Input:
  %   F  list of face indices, #faces by 3
  % Output:
  %   Fp  #faces by 3, where Fp(i,j) tells the index of the neighboring triangle
  %     to the jth edge of the ith triangle in F. -1 if the jth edge of the ith
  %     triangle in F is a border edge. (jth edge refers to the edge opposite
  %     the jth vertex: so triangle in a triangle (a,b,c), the 1st edge is
  %     b-->c, the 2nd is c-->b and the 3rd is a-->b
  %   Fi  #faces by 3, where Fi(i,j) tells the position on the neighboring
  %     triangle to the jth edge of the ith triangle in F. -1 if the jth edge 
  %     if the ith triangle in F is a border edge. Uses the same indexing of
  %     positions of edges on a triangle as above.
  %
  % For example:
  %
  % F = [ 1 3 2;
  %       2 3 4];
  % [Fp, Fi] = tt(F);
  % Fp = 
  %     2    -1    -1
  %    -1    -1     1
  % Fi = 
  %     3    -1    -1
  %    -1    -1     1
  %
