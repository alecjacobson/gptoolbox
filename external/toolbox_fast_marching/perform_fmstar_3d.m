%
%   'W' is the 3D weight matrix (the highest, the slowest the front will move).
%   'start_points' is a 3 x k array, start_points(:,i) is the ith starting point .
%   'end_points' is a 3 x 1 array, it is the goal.
%
%   'reduc_factor' is the reduction factor for the coarse scale
%       computation (eg. 0.5 will perform the heuristic computation
%       on a grid of half size).
