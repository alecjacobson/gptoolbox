function [D,S,Q] = perform_fast_marching_mesh(vertex, faces, start_points, options)

% perform_fast_marching_mesh - launch the Fast Marching algorithm on a 3D mesh.
%
%   [D,S,Q] = perform_fast_marching_mesh(vertex, faces, start_points, options)
%
%   vertex, faces: a 3D mesh
%   start_points(i) is the index of the ith starting point .
%
%   D is the distance function to the set of starting points.
%   S is the final state of the points : -1 for dead (ie the distance
%       has been computed), 0 for open (ie the distance is only a temporary
%       value), 1 for far (ie point not already computed). Distance function
%       for far points is Inf.
%   Q is the index of the closest point. Q is set to 0 for far points.
%       Q provide a Voronoi decomposition of the domain. 
%
%   Optional:
%   - You can provide non-uniform speed in options.W.
%   - You can provide special conditions for stop in options :
%       'options.end_points' : stop when these points are reached
%       'options.nb_iter_max' : stop when a given number of iterations is
%          reached.
%   - You can provide an heuristic in options.heuristic (typically that try to guess the distance
%       that remains from a given node to a given target).
%       This is an array of same size as W.
%   - You can provide a map L=options.constraint_map that reduce the set of
%       explored points. Only points with current distance smaller than L
%       will be expanded. Set some entries of L to -Inf to avoid any
%       exploration of these points.
