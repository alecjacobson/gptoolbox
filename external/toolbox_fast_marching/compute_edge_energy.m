% compute_edge_energy - compute an energy for fast marching.
%
%   W = compute_edge_energy(M,s,epsi);
%
%   W is the speed function for the front propagation
%   (should be high in the area of strong gradient).
%   The formula is :
%
%   1/W(x) = 1/(1 + |grad(M*G_s)|) + epsi
%
%   where G_s is a gaussian smoothing of width s.
