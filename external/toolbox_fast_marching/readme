The Fast Marching algorithm, introduced by Sethian (1996) is a 
numerical algorithm that is able to catch the viscosity solution 
of the Eikonal equation |grad(D)|=P. The level set {x \ F(x)=t} 
can be seen as a front advancing with speed P(x).
 
The resulting function D is a distance function, and if the speed 
P is constant, it can be seen as the distance function to a set 
of starting points.
  
The Fast Marching is very similar to the Dijkstra algorithm that 
finds shortest paths on graphs. Using a gradient descent of the 
distance function D, one is able to extract a good approximation 
of the shortest path (geodesic) in various settings (euclidean for 
P constant, and a weighted riemanian manifold with P varying).

Basic features:
* The functions 'perform_fast_marching_2d' and 'perform_fast_marching_3d' 
  compute the distance function from a set of starting points. 
* To extract the geodesics between these starting points and an 
  ending point, you can use 'extract_path_2d' and 'extract_path_3d'.
* There are also test applications 'test_fast_marching_2d'
  and 'test_fast_marching_3d' so that you can easily 
  understand the use of the functions.

Additional features: 
* Circular path extraction : a callback function can be passed
 to the C++ function 'perform_front_propagation_2d' to prevent
 the front to passing though some area. The function 
 'perform_circular_fast_marching_2d' implement a simple trick, 
 by prenventing the front to pass through an horizontal half line, 
 which in turn enable the extraction of circular paths.
 The function 'test_circular_fast_marching_2d' shows
 an application of this to cell segmentation.

* Constraint path planing : the script 'test_path_planing'
 shows the application of 3D fast marching to the extraction
 of optimal path for a tiny rectangle.
 The function 'generate_constrained_map' generate the 3D speed
 function for a given 2D map (the 2D speed function that 
 should be used if the object to move was a point).

The main computation are done in a mex file so it is very fast 
(using a Fibonacci heap structure). To compile the mex files, 
simply run 'compile_mex'. This should be ok if you have
set some C++ compiler (use 'mex -setup').
Precompiled version (.dll) for Windows are provided.
