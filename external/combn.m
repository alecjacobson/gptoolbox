function [M,IND] = combn(V,N)
% COMBN - all combinations of elements
%   M = COMBN(V,N) returns all combinations of N elements of the elements in
%   vector V. M has the size (length(V).^N)-by-N.
%
%   [M,I] = COMBN(V,N) also returns the index matrix I so that M = V(I).
%
%   V can be an array of numbers, cells or strings.
%
%   Example:
%     M = COMBN([0 1],3) returns the 8-by-3 matrix:
%       0     0     0
%       0     0     1
%       0     1     0
%       0     1     1
%       ...
%       1     1     1
%
%   All elements in V are regarded as unique, so M = COMBN([2 2],3) returns 
%   a 8-by-3 matrix with all elements equal to 2.
%
%   NB Matrix sizes increases exponentially at rate (n^N)*N. For larger
%   values of n and N, one could loop over the output of COMBNSUB
%   retrieving one or more rows of the output at a single time.

% History
% 1.1 updated help text
% 2.0 new faster algorithm
% 3.0 (aug 2006) implemented very fast algorithm
% 3.1 (may 2007) Improved algorithm Roger Stafford pointed out that for some values, the floor
% operation on floating points, according to the IEEE 754 standard, could return 
% erroneous values. His excellent solution was to add (1/2) to the values
% of A. 
% 3.2 (may 2007) changed help and error messages slightly
% 4.0 (may 2008) again a faster implementation, based on ALLCOMB, suggested on the
%     newsgroup comp.soft-sys.matlab on May 7th 2008 by "Helper". It was
%     pointed out that COMBN(V,N) equals ALLCOMB(V,V,V...) (V repeated N
%     times), ALLCMOB being faster. Actually version 4 is an improvement
%     over version 1 ... 
% 4.1 (jan 2010) removed call to FLIPLR, using refered indexing N:-1:1
%     (is faster, suggestion of Jan Simon, jan 2010), removed REPMAT, and
%     let NDGRID handle this
% 4.2 (apr 2011) corrrectly return a column vector for N = 1 (error pointed
%      out by Wilson).
% 4.3 (apr 2013) make a reference to COMBNSUB

% Version 2.0 
%     for i = N:-1:1

% Version 1.0
